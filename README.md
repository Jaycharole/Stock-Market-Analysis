### About the Project

A stock market, equity market, or share market is a gathering of buyers and sellers of stocks (also known as shares), which represent ownership claims on businesses; these may include securities listed on a public stock exchange as well as stock that is only traded privately, such as shares of private companies sold to investors through equity crowdfunding platforms. Typically, investments are undertaken with an investment strategy in mind.

The National Stock Exchange of India Ltd.'s main index is the NIFTY 50. (NSE). The Index follows the performance of a basket of blue-chip businesses, India's largest and most liquid equities. It contains 50 of the nearly 1600 businesses listed on the NSE, accounts for approximately 65 percent of its float-adjusted market value, and is an accurate representation of the Indian stock market.

The NIFTY 50 index encompasses significant sectors of the Indian economy and provides investment managers with exposure to the Indian market through a single, efficient portfolio. The Index has been in operation since April 1996 and is ideal for benchmarking, index funds, and index-based derivatives.

India Index Services and Products Ltd owns and manages the NIFTY 50. (IISL). IISL is India's first specialized corporation with an index as its primary product.

### About the dataset

The data represents the price history and trading volume of the fifty stocks in the NIFTY 50 index from India's NSE (National Stock Exchange). All databases are on a daily basis, with pricing and trading values distributed across. CVS files for each stock, as well as a metadata file containing some macro-information on the stock. The data ranges from January 1, 2000 to April 30, 2021.
